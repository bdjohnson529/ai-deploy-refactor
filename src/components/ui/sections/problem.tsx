              <p>We are in a period of rapid technology development. Within the past year AI has developed the ability to solve PhD level math problems, beat the worldâ€™s best programmers, and contribute to fundamental scientific research.</p>
              <p>Despite rapidly advancing capabilities, more than 50% of CEOs are struggling to adopt AI within their business. A small percentage of companies are successfully deploying AI, and the rest are struggling to keep pace and avoid getting left behind.</p>

Companies that remained have transformed the ways they use technology.</p>
              <p>The rate of technology advancement is now 10X what it was in 2010. Governments, investment firms and companies invested $250B into AI in the 2025 fiscal year alone. That investment has paved the way for the technology to advance faster than any technology we have seen before.</p>

              <p>AI systems are designed around data systems and operational processes. For AI use cases to be successful, they need access to the correct data, and the proper level of governance. <span className="text-blue-400 underline">How you deploy</span> AI is equally important, if not more important, than which AI technology you use.</p>
              <p>Data and operations are what makes your business unique. Successful AI deployments <span className="text-blue-400 underline">require customization</span> past simply purchasing an off-the-shelf technology. They require an investment in data architecture, business process mapping, and use case scoping.</p>

We work closely with your team from initial ideation to project delivery.
